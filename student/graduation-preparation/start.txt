=== Technical writing ===
No longer being offered\\
If your catalog year is 2018 or older, and you have not taken CS 260/280(Dent), you **must** change your catalog year\\

Here's what you will see in your Academic Requirements report will look like if you're missing your Technical Writing course:\\

**Changing your Catalog Year**\\
Email buchhofp@jmu.edu\\
Include student ID number, old year, desired new year\\
If you have not taken an algorithms course, you **must** enroll for CS 412 in the spring (we plan to offer 3 sections)\\
CS 374 (Databases) will count as an elective class\\

=== Checking graduation requirements ===
View your Academic Requirements report in MyMadison\\
  * https://www.jmu.edu/computing/ittraining/e-training/mymadison-academic-requirements-report/

Everything needs to be resolved before you are allowed to apply for graduation!

Contact your advisor if you see anything you think is wrong in the report: https://jmu-cs.as.me/advisor 

Note: the department will make substitutions or waivers only in rare cases:
  * Transfer students may not have received official transfer credit for 159 or 240
  * Elective classes outside the department that were approved before enrollment


=== Major GPA ===
Weighted average (by credit hours) of:
  * Every CS course (including cross-listed ones)
  * Calculus class(es)
  * Statistics

If a student has taken a course more than once, then only the highest grade is used to compute their major GPA, even if they did not retake a course with the repeat/forgive option
