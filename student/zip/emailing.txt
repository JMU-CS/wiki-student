===== Emailing a .zip File =====

The JMU email system strips-off ''%.zip%'' files because the system administrators deem them to be a security risk (because a user might accidentally expand them which could put files anywhere on the file system). So, you must rename ''%.zip%'' files before you can attach them to an email.

The convention at JMU is to rename them to ''%.jmu%''.

Note, however, that you have to be careful when doing so because many operating systems hide the file extension (i.e., the characters after the "dot") by default. To learn how to see the file extension, search the WWW for "show file extension" for your operating system.
