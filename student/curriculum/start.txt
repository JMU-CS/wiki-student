==== Prerequisites ====

The easiest way to see the prerequisite structure is to view the

==== Anticipated Course Offerings ====

Although the CS department cannot guarantee that certain courses will be offered in the future, we plan course
offerings ahead of time and do our best to follow the plan. Here is the
