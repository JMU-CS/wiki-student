===== Using Git with Eclipse =====

The Eclipse plugin that integrate Git with Eclipse is called EGit.

==== Installation ====

EGit should have been installed when you installed Eclipse. If not, you can install it using any of the methods described on [[ https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/ | the EGit downloads page ]]. 

==== Opening the Git Perspective ====

Eclipse enables you to present and interact with the same project in a variety of different ways, each of which is called a "perspective". To enable the Git perspective, click on <key>Window+Perspective+OpenPerspective</key> and select <key>Git</key> (if it is available) or <key>Other...+Git</key>.

==== Creating a Local Repository ====

The easiest way to create a local repository is to:

  - Open the Git Perspective
  - Click on "Create a new local Git repository"

Note that you should not put the repository under the directory containing the Eclipse workspace.

==== Adding a Project to Version Control ====

A project should be added to version control only once. After that, files in the project can be added to version control individually (or in groups). It is best to create a local repository for the easiest to add a project to version control

  - Right-click on the project
  - Pull down to <key>Team+Share</key>
  - Cick on <key>Git</key>
  - Select the repository
