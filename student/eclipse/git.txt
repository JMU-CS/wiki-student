===== Using Git with Eclipse =====

The Eclipse plugin that integrate Git with Eclipse is called EGit.

==== Installation ====

EGit should have been installed when you installed Eclipse. If not, you can install it using any of the methods described on [[ https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/ | the EGit downloads page ]]. 

==== Opening the Git Perspective ====

Eclipse enables you to present and interact with the same project in a variety of different ways, each of which is called a "perspective". To enable the Git perspective, click on <key>Window+Perspective+OpenPerspective</key> and select <key>Git</key> (if it is available) or <key>Other...+Git</key>.

==== Creating a Local Repository ====

The easiest way to create a local repository is to:

  - Open the [[ #opening_the_git_perspective | Git Perspective ]]
  - Click on "Create a new local Git repository"

Note that you should not put the repository under the directory containing the Eclipse workspace.

==== Adding a Project to Version Control ====

A project should be added to version control only once. After that, files in the project can be added to version control individually (or in groups). It is best to create a local repository for the easiest to add a project to version control

To add a project to version control:

  - [[  #creating_a_local_repository | Create a local repository ]] (if you have not already done so)
  - Right-click on the project
  - Pull down to <key>Team+Share</key>
  - If asked to choose a code management system, click on <key>Git</key>
  - Browse to the local repository to use (or create a local repository in the parent folder of the project)
  - Click on <key>Finish</key>

The name of the local repository you are using for this project will now appear next to the name of the project. In additions, the icons on any directories/files in the project will change to indicate that they have not yet been committed.

If you look at the project directory (outside of Eclipse) you will see that it is now empty, and if you look at the
repository directory (again, outside of Eclipse) you will see that it now contains all of the directories and files that were in the project' directory.

==== Ignoring Files ====

The easiest way to instruct Git to ignore files is to:

  - Open the [[ #opening_the_git_perspective | Git Perspective  ]]
  - Click on the "Git Staging" tab
  - Right-click on the file/directory
  - Pull down to <key>Ignore</key>

You can also edit the ''.gitignore'' file (outside of Eclipse).


==== Committing Files ====

The easiest way to instruct Git to commit files to the local repository is:

  - Open the [[ Git Perspective | opening_the_git_perspective ]]
  - Click on the "Git Staging" tab
  - Select the appropriate files in the "Unstaged Changes" list
  - Click on <key>+</key>
  - Enter a descriptive commit message 
  - Click on <key>Commit</key>


==== Summary of Common Git Commands ====

Most Git documentation assumes that you are issuing ''git'' commands within a shell. The following table summarizes how to execute these commands using Egit.

^ ''git'' Command ^ EGit Equivalent ^
| ''add'' | Right-click on the file and then <key>Team+Add to Index</key> |
| ''checkout '' | 
| ''clone'' | Open the Git Perspective and click on {{eclipse_git-clone.png}} |
| ''commit'' | Right-click on the project/files and then <key>Team+Commit...</key> |
| ''pull'' | Right-click on the project and then <key>Team+Pull</key> |
| ''push'' | Right-click on the project and then <key>Team+Push</key> |

To add an entry to the ''.gitignore'' file, right-click on the file and then <key>Team+Ignore</key>.
