===== Using Git with Eclipse =====

The Eclipse plugin that integrate Git with Eclipse is called EGit.

==== Installation ====

EGit should have been installed when you installed Eclipse. If not, you can install it using any of the methods described on [[ https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/ | the EGit downloads page ]]. 

==== Opening the Git Perspective ====

Eclipse enables you to present and interact with the same project in a variety of different ways, each of which is called a "perspective". To enable the Git perspective, click on <key>Window+Perspective+OpenPerspective</key> and select <key>Git</key> (if it is available) or <key>Other...+Git</key>.

The easiest way to create a local repository is to:
