====== For Windows and Mac ======

Please go here for the download and instructions on the client https://www.jmu.edu/computing/network/pulse-secure.shtml

====== For Linux ======

These instructions assume an Ubuntu/Linux Mint installation. Much of it should apply to any Linux, however.

It also assumes you are enrolled in Duo. Make sure you're enrolled in Duo because the VPN requires it.

  * Open a terminal.
  * Install openconnect: <code>sudo apt-get install openconnect</code>
  * Connect to the vpn: <code>sudo openconnect --juniper vpn.jmu.edu</code>
  * You'll be asked for a Username, your e-ID goes there.
  * You'll be asked for a Password, the same password you use for Canvas/MyMadison goes there.
  * You'll be asked for a Password#2, there are several options you can choose here. You are essentially choosing how you want Duo to authenticate you.
    * Assuming you have Duo installed on your Android or iOS device, you'll likely want to type "push". This will send a push notification to your device for you to then act upon.
    * You can also type sms1, to send a list of Duo codes to your phone, which can then be entered to grant access.
    * If you have a Yubikey, you can use the codes it generates for Password#2 as well simply by connecting it to your computer and pressing the button.
  * You should now be connected to the VPN.
