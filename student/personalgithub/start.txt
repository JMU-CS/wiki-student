====== GitHub for Personal Use ======

If you work on multiple computers (e.g., a laptop and a desktop), you may want to keep your code on GitHub so that you can access it from all of them. This page links to step-by-step instructions for doing this in a variety of different environments. 

Note that these instructions are generic. Different courses may use Git and GitHub in different ways and you should make sure you understand the requirements of your courses, if any.
