====== Celebrating Simmons ======

Join us in celebrating 14 years of Dr. Sharon Simmons exceptional leadership as our CS Department Head! We want your help to commemorate Sharon's remarkable contributions and celebrate the countless ways she's shaped our program.

Please share your fond memories, notable experiences, or transformative encounters you've had with Dr. Simmons. Even if you didn't interact with her directly, if you enjoyed the culture of our department in the past 14-years, that's in large thanks to her!

Please record (in "Portrait" not "Landscape" mode) your video message and DM it to @jmucs on Instagram
  * If you record on your camera, we’ll have the option to save it.
