====== CS Electives ======

All CS students are required to take three upper level CS electives. The specifics here depend on your Catalog Year (you can reference the details in your Academic Requirements page in MyMadison Student Center):

  * if you're on the 19-20 Catalog Year, you need three CS electives above 300 and //at least two must be above 345//.
  * if you're on the 22-23 Catalog Year, you need three CS electives above 300 and //at least two must be above 332//.

So, if you want to count both CS 330 and CS 343 toward your CS Elective Requirements, you'll need to make sure your catalog year is 22-23.

====== Defining Terms ======

A "CS Elective" is any CS course you "elect" to take - meaning, they aren't the required core courses in the CS major. 

You're required to take //one// of our five System Electives. If you elect to take another one, it would count as a CS elective. 

Note: You are required to take only one of our Algorithm classes (CS 412, CS 452); you are not permitted to take both.
