====== Defining terms ======

A "CS Elective" is any CS course you "elect" to take - meaning, they aren't required courses for the CS major. 

You're required to take //one// of our five System Electives. If you elect to take another one, it would count as a CS elective. 

Note: You are required to take only one of our Algorithm classes (CS 412, CS 452); you are not permitted to take both. 

====== A note on timing ======

You should have your desired catalog year finalized before you apply for graduation.
