===== Wireless =====

JMU IT has instructions for connecting to the ''JMU-Official-Wireless'' network from macOS and Windows here: [[http://www.jmu.edu/computing/network/wireless-guide-generic.shtml]]

If you're running Linux, you might need to set things up manually. For example, on Linux Mint 19 you need to click the "Connect to Hidden Network..." button. Here are the settings:

==== JMU-Official-Wireless ====

  * **SSID:** JMU-Official-Wireless
  * **Wireless security:** WPA & WPA2 Enterprise
  * **Authentication:** Protected EAP (PEAP)
  * **Anonymous identity:** <leave blank>
  * **CA certificate:** /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/AddTrust_External_Root.crt
  * **PEAP version:** Version 0
  * **Inner authentication:** MSCHAPv2
  * **Username:** <your JMU e-ID>
  * **Password:** <your JMU password>

==== eduroam ====

For a more automated connection setup, you can use the ''eduroam'' SSID and the [[https://cat.eduroam.org|eduroam CAT tool]]. Read the [[http://www.jmu.edu/computing/network/eduroam.shtml|JMU IT webpage]] for eduroam. 

  - Go to [[https://cat.eduroam.org]]
  - Choose 'James Madison University'
  - Download the Linux Installer
  - Run the Python script that you receive
  - Click **Ok**
  - Click **Yes**
  - Enter ''eID@jmu.edu'' where ''eID'' is your JMU e-ID.
  - Enter your JMU e-ID password
  - You may need to tell Mint to attempt to connect to eduroam

You will need to re-run this every time your password updates.
