===== Wireless =====

JMU IT has instructions for connecting to the ''JMU-Official-Wireless'' network from macOS and Windows here: [[http://www.jmu.edu/computing/network/wireless-guide-generic.shtml]]

If you're running Linux, you might need to set things up manually. For example, on Linux Mint 19 you need to click the "Connect to Hidden Network..." button. Here are the settings:

  * **SSID:** JMU-Official-Wireless
  * **Wireless security:** WPA & WPA2 Enterprise
  * **Authentication:** Protected EAP (PEAP)
  * **Anonymous identity:** <leave blank>
  * **CA certificate:** /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/AddTrust_External_Root.crt
  * **PEAP version:** Version 0
  * **Inner authentication:** MSCHAPv2
  * **Username:** <your JMU e-ID>
  * **Password:** <your JMU password>
