====== Online Semester Survival Guide ======

===== TA Resources =====

The computer science department has a bunch of awesome TAs that are available to help with lower division classes like CS 101, CS 149, CS 159, CS 227, etc. They also run weekly review sessions for several of these courses. For the online semester, they are using Microsoft Teams to organize TA hours and connect with students. You can find information on when the TAs are available and how to connect with them at the [[department:cs-success:start| TA Hours/Review Sessions ]] page.

===== Accessing Campus Computing Resources =====

Many of the computing services used in CS classes, like [[student:autolab:start|Autolab]], require that your computer either be on the campus network or connected through a VPN. For students who are not currently living on campus, the best thing to do is to run Pulse Secure VPN to connect your computer to the campus network. The library has detailed text-based instructions for installing Pulse Secure VPN on [[https://www.lib.jmu.edu/connect/pulse-secure-windows-instructions/|Windows]] and [[https://www.lib.jmu.edu/connect/pulse-secure-mac-osx-instructions/|Mac]]. JMU IT also has a [[https://www.jmu.edu/computing/internet-and-network/pulse-secure.shtml|External page of instructions]] that includes screenshots. For Linux and ChromeOS users, we have [[student:vpn:start|compiled our own instructions]].

===== How do I access the student server (“stu”) from home to do my coursework? =====
Many classes require the use of the gcc compiler for compiling C programs, which are available on the CS lab machines on campus. To access stu and the lab machines virtually home, follow the guide written [[student:stu:basics|here]]. Don't want to use vim or nano to edit your program files? Mount your remote directory from stu onto your local machine and then open into the editor of your choice on your local machine by using our guide [[student:utilities:sshfs|here]].
