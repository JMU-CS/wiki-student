===== Help Submitting Labs =====

This page concerns submitting a lab via Gradescope. In particular, labs that require to be in PDF format like the ones found in [[https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=257227|CS261]].

Unless you are editing the PDF directly, you need to convert an image of your completed lab to PDF format. Gradescope may encounter issues when uploading a PDF generated with certain PDF editors; thus, this page is for verified processes for submitting valid PDFs that don't encounter issues when submitted for grading. 

==== Submitting Using a Physical Scanner ====
The most traditional way of converting your hand-written work to PDF is a document scanner. These can be purchased as a standalone unit or be part of an all-in-one printer. You may also use the scanners in the [[https://ask.lib.jmu.edu/faq/76884|JMU Libraries]] or your [[https://www.usa.gov/libraries-and-archives|local library]].

==== Submitting Using Gradescope ====
Gradescope has [[https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/22016028459789-Using-the-Gradescope-Mobile-App-for-Students#h_01HH0C6Z9XRHCCCMYYN8840ZFA|built-in support]] for both document scanning and existing files that's already present on your device. 

:!: If you are submitting with files already present on your device, keep in mind that Gradescope //will not// automatically crop and re-size the image for you.
