===== Using VSCode Remotely on Stu for C (Windows) =====

VSCode has extensions for C/C++ Intellisense; however, it will not work unless set up as described below.

==== Prerequisites ====
  - Do //**not**// use the Remote SSH Extension for VSCode to access stu as this creates extra processes on stu.                
  - Install [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10|WSL Version 2]] with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
  - (Optional) Install the new [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started| Windows Terminal]]

==== In WSL ====  
  - Start Ubuntu from its CLI or the Windows Terminal, username and password can be anything
  - Run sudo add-apt-repository universe (may already be enabled)
  - Run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  - Run sudo apt install gcc
  - Mount your stu directory remotely **//from within WSL//** according to [[student:utilities:sshfs|the instructions for Linux found here]].
  
==== In VSCode ====
  - Start VS Code.
  - Press F1, select Remote-WSL: New Window for the default distro, or Remote-WSL: New Window using Distro for a specific distro (if you have multiple installed). There will be a first-time setup process. \\ {{:student:vscode:remote-wsl.png?nolink&400|}} 
  - You should see this something similar to this in the bottom left corner. \\ {{:student:vscode:wsl_indicator.png?nolink&400|}}
  - Use the File menu to open your remotely mounted stu dir or project folder at ~/home/your-eid/mnt/stu.
  - Install the [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack|Remote Development Extension Pack]].
  
  ==== While Working ===
    * You will need to install any external libraries in WSL (ex: OpenSSL for CS457) 
    * SSH from your WSL terminal into stu to compile and run code to ensure compatibility. 
    * Avoid compiling and running from your local WSL.
