===== Vivify Scrum Practices and Conventions =====

Vivify Scrum uses some non-standard terminology (e.g., it does not use the term "acceptance criteria" or "definition of done" but does have "checklists") and allows some non-standard practices (e.g., tasks can have checklists). To use standard practices and avoid any confusion, you must use the following practices and comply with the following conventions.

  - Each sprintable backlog item must be have an item type of "Story".
  - Every sprintable backlog item must have a single checklist containing the  acceptance criteria.
  - Most sprintable backlog items should have subitems.
  - Every subitem must have an item type of "Task".
  - A task must not have a checklist. (A task should be small so a checklist would not provide any additional useful information.)
  - The team must have an assignee for every task.
  - Stories must not have assignees (since the individual tasks do).
  - The team member that is the assignee on a task must mark it as "Done" when it is completed.
  - The team must have (at least) one reviewer for every story.
  - Tasks must not have reviewers (because they will be reviewed by the reviewer for the story).
  - Epics can (and should) be included in the product backlog. Since there is no specific item type for epics, they must be classified as "Story".
  - Since VivifyScrum does not allow multiple levels of drill-down, when an  epic is decomposed into sprintable stories it must be removed from the product backlog.
