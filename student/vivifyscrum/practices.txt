===== Vivify Scrum Practices and Conventions =====

Vivify Scrum uses some non-standard terminology (e.g., it does not use the term "acceptance criteria" or "definition of done" but does have "checklists") and allows some non-standard practices (e.g., tasks can have checklists). To use standard practices and avoid any confusion, you must use the following practices and comply with the following conventions.

  - Each sprintable backlog item must be have an "item type" of "Story".
  - Every sprintable backlog item must have a single "Checklist" containing the  acceptance criteria.
  - Most sprintable backlog items should have "SUBITEMS".
  - Every "SUBITEM" must have an "item type" of "Task".
  - A "Task" must not have a checklist. (A "Task" should be small so a "Checklist" would not provide any additional useful information.)
  - The team must have an "Assignee" for every "Task".
  - Stories must not have "Assignees" (since the individual tasks do).
  - The team member that is the "Assignee" on a "Task" must mark it as "Done" when it is completed.
  - The team must have a "Reviewer" for every "Story".
  - Tasks must not have "Reviewers" (because they will be reviewed by the reviewer for the story).
  - Epics can (and should) be included in the product backlog. Since there is no specific item type for epics, they must be classified as "Story".
  - Since Vivify Scrum does not allow multiple levels of "drill-down", when an  epic is decomposed into sprintable stories it must be removed from the product backlog.
