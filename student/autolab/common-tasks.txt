===== Autolab Common Tasks =====

This page provides information about various common tasks.

==== Accessing Autolab ====

Autolab can be loaded into any modern WWW browser from the following URL:

  * [[https://autolab.cs.jmu.edu/ | https://autolab.cs.jmu.edu/ ]] 

It is only available to members of the JMU community. So, if you are off-campus, you will first need to sign into the [[student:vpn:start | JMU Virtual Private Network (VPN) ]] .


==== Logging In ====

The login screen looks something like the following.

Note that you must use your ''dukes.jmu.edu'' email address and your
Autolab (not your JMU) password.


==== Courses ====

The courses page looks something like the following:

{{courses.png}}

Your current courses are listed at the top of the page, and your
completed courses (if any) are listed at the bottom of the page. For
each course, the system shows its name, the semester, and the
assignments. Clicking on an individual course will provide you with
information about the assignments in that course.


==== Assignments in a Course====

If you "drill down" into a course you will see an assignments page that looks
something like the following.

{{assignments.png}}

Clicking on an individual assignment will enable you to
submit your code and view your submissions.


==== Individual Assignments ==== 

The page for an assignment looks something like the following.

You can submit your code by (1) affirming that you have complied with the JMU honor code and all course-specific policies, and (2) clicking on "SUBMIT" (which will then prompt you to select the file to submit).

You can also see information about due dates/times, the number of
times you can still submit (which may be infinite depending on the
course/assignment), and your submission history.

In some courses, you will also be able to click on "View writeup" to
see the details of the assignment and/or on "Download the handout" to
get any code/data that were provided for the assignment. In other courses you
will have to get this information from the course WWW site or from
Canvas.


==== Submission Results ====

After you submit your code, you will be presented with a page that
looks something like the following.

If the points for your current submission are shown as dashes then you
will need to **reload the page after waiting a few seconds** (perhaps
more than once).

Once the submission has been graded (i.e., when the points are listed
as numbers), you can click on any of them to get the feedback from the
automatic grading system. Note that, though there are different links,
each one provides feedback on all of the criteria. The only thing that
varies from link-to-link is the "Score for this problem" at the
bottom, which shows the points awarded **only for that criterion**.
See the [[student:autolab:grade-report | description of the grade report ]] 
for more information.

After the assignment has been completely graded, you may also receive
feedback from the instructor on the quality of your code. You can
obtain this feedback (if it is provided) by clicking on the magnifying
glass icon under the last submission.


==== Individual Submissions ====

If you click on the magnifying glass for a submission, you will be presented with a page that contains a list of the files you submitted. If you click on the magnifying glass for a particular file you will be presented with a page that looks something like the following.

Any annotations/feedback will appear as gray boxes in your code. You can expand an individual annotation by clicking on it, or expand/​collapse all annotations by clicking on the buttons above the code.
