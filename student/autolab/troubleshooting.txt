===== Troubleshooting Autolab =====

==== Code Won't Compile ====

Autolab has problems with non-ASCII characters. In such cases, you may not even be able to view your submission. This is most commonly a result of non-ASCII characters in comments (e.g., smart quotes, copyright symbols, degree symbols) that find there way into the code when the student cuts-and-pastes from another document.

==== Official Tests Won't Compile ====

This is most likely because your code does not conform to the specifications. Common examples include: misnamed methods/functions, a mis-packaged submission, case problems,  and missing classes/files.
