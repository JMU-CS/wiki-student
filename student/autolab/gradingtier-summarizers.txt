===== Understanding the Feedback from gradingtier Summarizers =====

This page provides information about the feedback provided by the autograders
that use gradingtier (and Checkstyle, JUnit, and JaCoCo/EclEmma) to
assess Java programming assignments.


==== Feedback about Style ====

Feedback about style includes a list of defects (generated by
Checkstyle) organized by file that looks something like the following.

==== Feedback about Correctness ====

Feedback about correctness (e.g., official tests and self tests) includes a list of test failures (generated
by JUnit). You may be given information only about the test, in which case
it will look something like the following.

You may also be given hints, in which case
it will look something like the following.

Or, you may also be given detailes about the failure, in which case
it will look something like the following.

==== Feedback about Coverage of Your Tests ====

Feedback about the coverage of your tests (generated
by JaCoCo/EclEmma) is organized by class and method, and looks something like
the following.

Note that if a method contains no branches then the branch coverage
line will be omitted. Note also that JaCoCo uses the term "branches"
differently from the way some other people do. Specifically, the
number of "branches" is the sum of the number of possible Boolean
values in an expression.
