==== JMU CS Listserv ====

The department maintains an email distribution list [[ https://listserv.jmu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=JMUCS-L | JMUCS-L]] that is used for official event announcements, advising information, and job position advertisements among other things. All CS students should be on the distribution list. If you suspect you have not been added, you can add yourself using [[ https://listserv.jmu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=JMUCS-L&A=1 | this subscription link]].
