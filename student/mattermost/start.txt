====== Mattermost ======

Mattermost is a team-chat service (a free and open source alternative to e.g. slack.com ). You might use this to chat generally with students, faculty, and alumni of JMUCS, or with clubs or other special interests (such as professors' research labs). You can sign in with your JMU EID by:
  - Going to https://chat.cs.jmu.edu 
  - clicking "Sign in with: GitLab" (see figure)
     *  {{:student:mattermost:screenshot_2018-08-23_15.09.34.png?nolink&400|}}
  - on the resulting page (with the "LDAP" tab selected, as in the figure), enter your JMU EID and associated password (as you would on MyMadison). 
     *  {{:student:mattermost:sign_in_to_jmu_cs_gitlab_via_ldap.png?nolink&400|}}
  - The first time you do this, you may be asked to grant permission. You should do so.
