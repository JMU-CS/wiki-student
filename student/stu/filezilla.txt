        - Site Manager button
        - the files on the computer you're currently using (i.e. your laptop, called the "local" computer)
        - the files on "stu" the JMU CS server that hosts your account (the computer that you're not currently using, but have connected to is the "remote" computer)

  - Name the site something that makes sense to you, while the server is named "stu" (an abbreviation for its fill name for "Student Bizzy Werkinit III"), perhaps that name doesn't mean much to you, so you can name it "jmucs" or "DoD" or whatever you want idc 💁
  - With your newly named site selected, make the following selections/entries for the fields in the right half of the Site Manager window:
      - Protocol: SFTP
      - Host: stu.cs.jmu.edu
      - Port: it's fine to leave this blank, probably it's 22 if you're just curious
      - Logon Type: Ask for Password
      - User: your EID (not capitalized, without the @dukes)
  - Confirm that your settings look like this, but with a different <del>crime against humanity! computers don't name people</del> EID
