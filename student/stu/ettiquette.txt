The student server is a shared resource, and as with any shared resource it is important to be considerate of others who are using the resource. Please make sure the machine remains responsive by closely monitoring any processes that you have running and terminating them if they are using an abnormal amount of CPU time, memory, or I/O bandwidth. You can use the [[ http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html | top ]] utility to monitor resource-intensive processes that are running on the system.
