"stu" is a server running Linux that is available to all students in the JMU
Computer Science Department.



==== Logging in to stu ====

You can login to "stu" using an SSH client (and the host name   ''%%stu.cs.jmu.edu%%''). All modern operating systems should come   with command-line SSH client (usually named ''%%ssh%%''). GUI SSH   clients are also available, but add little.

You can avoid the need to authenticate yourself (with your eID and password) each time you login [[ using a public/private key pair | student:utilities:start:keypairs]]. This is particularly useful when using another protocol (e.g., Subversion or Git) on top of SSH.


==== Transferring Files to stu ====


You can transfer files to "stu" using an SCP client (and the host name   ''%%stu.cs.jmu.edu%%''). 

==== Using stu as an HTTP Server ====


You (should) have a directory named ''%%www%%'' in your home directory.   Any file that you put in that directory will be available to the   public as a "web page" (i.e., it will be served in response to an HTTP GET   request) from the server ''%%w3stu.cs.jmu.edu%%'' under your   e-ID.


For example, if Prof. Fakename (i.e., ''%%fakenazx%%'')   put a file named ''%%test.html%%'' in her ''%%www%%''   directory it would be accessible to the public using the URL   as ''%%w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/fakenazx/test.html%%''.

Of course, the HTTP server must have permission to read the file. So,   the file must be world-readable.
