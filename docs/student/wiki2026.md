# Wiki Update (Jan 2026)

The JMU CS Wiki launched in summer 2018 and has grown through many [contributions][C] from faculty, staff, and students.
The original site was built using [DokuWiki](https://dokuwiki.org/).
In late 2025, we undertook a major redesign to meet [Title II Web Accessibility][T] guidelines, improve usability, and modernize the platform.
The wiki is now a static website generated with [Zensical](https://zensical.org/).

All content from the original wiki has been migrated.
Pages were converted from DokuWiki to Markdown, unreferenced media files were archived, missing alt text was added to images, and headings were standardized (all pages now begin with a level‑1 heading).
The `/start` suffix has been removed from URLs; a redirect rule is in place so existing links that include `/start` should continue to work.

The new wiki will be easier to maintain.
The source is on GitHub and can be cloned for offline editing, while still supporting in‑browser edits.
Use the view/edit icons (:material-file-eye-outline:/:material-file-edit-outline:) in the top‑right corner of each page, or visit the [JMU-CS/wiki-student][R] repository.
All changes are tracked as commits, and the full revision history from the original wiki has been preserved.
