# Free Software

## Zero-cost Software

Many software and technologies companies make their commercial software or services available at no cost to university students:

- Amazon's [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)
- GitHub's [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- JetBrain's [Desktop IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) (including IntelliJ IDEA)
- Microsoft's [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)
- VMWare products at [OnTheHub](https://jmucs.onthehub.com/)

Besides VMWare products, other packages are available from [OnTheHub](https://onthehub.com/). Search for JMU and choose either "James Madison University" or "College of Integrated Science and Engineering" as the department to find other packages.

**Important:** The above offerings are "free as in beer" not "free as in speech" (for more info, see "[gratis vs. libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre)" and the [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) movement). For the most part, these companies make their software and services available for free with the goal of acquiring you or your employer as a paying customer after you graduate.
