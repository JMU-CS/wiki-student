# Notifications

The default notification settings in Canvas (and the only notification settings in Gradescope) are a bit too noisy. The onslaught is merciless and is more likely to worsen than improve as your career progresses. You have to take charge of your attention and protect it from these 🧛‍♂️ energy vampires!

## Canvas

Consider visiting <https://canvas.jmu.edu/profile/communication> and:

1.  disabling all notifications
2.  adding back as few as possible that you think would be helpful, e.g. enable Email notification for "Announcements" and "Conversations"

## Email Filters
