# Using the GNU C++ Compiler

## Overview

[The GNU Compiler Collection](http://directory.fsf.org/devel/compilers/gcc.html) (GCC) is an integrated collection of compilers for several languages, including C, C++, Java and Fortran.

Our interest here is with the [C/C++ compiler](http://directory.fsf.org/gpp.html).

## Syntax

The g++ command has the following syntax:

|                                                   |             |
|--------------------------------------------------:|-------------|
| **g++** \[**-***option...*\] *file*... \[*option* | *file*\]... |

where *option* denotes an option or switch (see below) and *file* denotes a file name.

## Options

The list of valid options/switches for the g++ command includes the following:

| Option               | Purpose                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c                    | Compiles without linking                                           |
| D*name*=*definition* | Defines a symbol (as with `#define`)                               |
| E                    | Stop after the preprocessing stage                                 |
| g                    | Produce debugging information                                      |
| I                    | Searches the given directory for "includes"                        |
| l*libname*           | Searches the specified library when linking                        |
| o*filename*          | Names the output file                                              |
| M                    | Instead of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for use by `make` |
| -help                | Provides (some) help                                               |
| -version             | Displays the version number                                        |

## Examples

The following command compiles (but does not link) the C source file named `test.c` and creates the file `test.o`:

``` bash
g++ -c test.c
```

The following command first defines the symbol `DEBUG` in the C++ source file named `Demo.cpp` and then compiles and links it (creating an executable file named `Demo`).

``` bash
g++ -DDEBUG=VERBOSE Demo.cpp -o Demo
```

The following command "includes" files from the directory `/myfiles/include` in addition to the standard INCLUDE directory.

``` bash
g++ -I/myfiles/include Demo.cpp -o Demo
```

The following commands first compile the source files for a small application (written in C) and then links them into an executable named `example`.

``` bash
g++ -c account.c
g++ -c example.c
g++ example.o account.o -o example
```

## Error and Warning Messages

Error and warning messages generated by the GCC are often less than clear. There are several places you can go for help, including:
