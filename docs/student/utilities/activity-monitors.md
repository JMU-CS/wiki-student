===== Monitoring System Activity/Usage =====

When writing both applications programs and systems programs it is
sometimes necessary to monitor memory usage (e.g., for leaks) and/or
CPU usage (e.g., for bottlenecks). All operatings systems have some tools
that can perform basic monitoring.

==== MS Windows ====

Press <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>Alt</key>+<key>Del</key> and click on the <key>Task List</key> button.


==== OS X ====

Run the "Activity Monitor" (e.g.,  <key>Command</key>+<key>Spacebar</key>, enter "Activity Monitor" in Spotlight, and click on "Activity Monitor").


==== UNIX/Linux ====

From the command line, run ''%%top%%'' (and type <key>q</key> when done).


In Gnome, run the ''%%gnome-system-monitor%%''.
