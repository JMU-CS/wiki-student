# Monitoring System Activity/Usage

When writing both applications programs and systems programs it is
sometimes necessary to monitor memory usage (e.g., for leaks) and/or
CPU usage (e.g., for bottlenecks). All operatings systems have some tools
that can perform basic monitoring.

## MS Windows

Press "Ctrl"+"Alt"+"Del" and click on the "Task List" button.

## OS X

Run the "Activity Monitor" (e.g., "Command"+"Spacebar", enter "Activity Monitor" in Spotlight, and click on "Activity Monitor").

## UNIX/Linux

From the command line, run `top` (and type "q" when done).

In Gnome, run the `gnome-system-monitor`.
