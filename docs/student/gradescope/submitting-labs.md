# Help Submitting Labs

This page concerns submitting a lab via Gradescope. In particular, labs that require to be in PDF format like the ones found in [CS261](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=257227).

Unless you are editing the PDF directly, you need to convert an image of your completed lab to PDF format. Gradescope may encounter issues when uploading a PDF generated with certain PDF editors; thus, this page is for verified processes for submitting valid PDFs that don't encounter issues when submitted for grading.
To avoid errors, **do not submit multi-page labs as a single page**. Put another way: do not submit a 2-page lab as a 1-page document. Gradescope may fail to locate where your answers are on the document.

## Submitting Using a Physical Scanner

The most traditional way of converting your hand-written work to PDF is a document scanner. These can be purchased as a standalone unit or be part of an all-in-one printer. You may also use the scanners in the [JMU Libraries](https://ask.lib.jmu.edu/faq/76884) or your [local library](https://www.usa.gov/libraries-and-archives).

## Submitting Using Gradescope

Gradescope has [built-in support](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/22016028459789-Using-the-Gradescope-Mobile-App-for-Students#h_01HH0C6Z9XRHCCCMYYN8840ZFA) for both document scanning and existing files that's already present on your device.

:!: If you are submitting with files already present on your device, keep in mind that Gradescope *will not* automatically crop and re-size the image for you.

### Submitting Using a PDF Editor

If you have images on your computer you want to convert to PDF, you may want to use a PDF editor.

### Adobe Acrobat Pro

While you may have heard of [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/), it unfortunately does not support editing PDFs. To obtain a first-party solution, you must purchase [Adobe Acrobat Pro](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/acrobat-pro.html) (\$20 per month [for students](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pricing/students.html)).

### SimplePDF

A third-party, free, web-based PDF editor. [SimplePDF](https://simplepdf.com/) has been in development for a few years and still receives updates.

## Submitting Using a Scanner App

The Gradescope app can behave inconsistently at times, or the scanner may not capture your work clearly; in this case, you may want to explore a 3rd party scanner app to generate the PDF needed to submit your work.

### Adobe Scan

[Adobe Scan](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html) is a first-party app found in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-pdf-ocr-scanner/id1199564834). This app is ideal because it supports IOS and Android; however, it requires an Adobe account and stores your documents in the cloud by default.
