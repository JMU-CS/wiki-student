# CISE Career & Internship Fair

Each Fall and Spring, our college hosts a tailored career and internship fair where the majority of employers are seeking computer science and/or information technology students. Generally, the fall career fair is ideal for job offers and the spring career fair is idea of internships, but you can find both opportunities each time.

## Be Prepared

Given feedback from the spring 2023 career fair, here’s what employers who attend recommend:

Research employers in advance: do not expect them to give you a speech about who they are and what they do. If you talk to a company you haven’t researched, tell them about your experience and ask them specific questions.

You need to guide the initial conversation: talk about what you’re interested in and see if/how it lines up with the company.

Have good answers for the following questions:

* What are you short-term and long-term career goals?
* What are you passionate about?
* What are you looking for in a job/internship?
