# Advising Dual Math

A minor or dual major in mathematics is an excellent pairing with computer science. Many interesting areas / problems in computer science require more advanced mathematics than is required of general computer science students. For example, graphics programming and machine learning both rely heavily on linear algebra.

## Courses that Double Count for CS and Math

Cross-listed courses automatically count as both a CS and a Math course. Other courses may count under certain circumstances. Below is a list of both cross-listed courses and others that can count.

CS courses that can count as mathematics courses:

- CS 452 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms): cross-listed as MATH 452

Math courses that can count as CS courses:

- MATH 227 (Discrete Structures I): cross-listed as CS 227
- MATH 245 (Discrete Mathematics): A C- or better in this course can be used in place of CS 227 to satisfy the CS discrete math requirement. A student will need to obtain an override from the CS Undergraduate Program Director to sign up for CS 240 since MyMadison only knows the prerequisite of CS 227.
- MATH 318 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics): A C- or better in this course can be used in place of MATH 220 or MATH 229 to satisfy the CS statistics requirement.
- MATH 448 (Numerical Analysis): cross-listed as CS 448
- MATH 449 (Numerical Analysis for Differential Equations): cross-listed as CS 449

## Advice for Pursuing a Mathematics Minor with CS

A math minor consists of the core calculus sequence (MATH 231/232 or 235 as well as MATH 236 for a total of 8 or 10 credits), followed by 10 credits (i.e., three courses as long as at least one of them is 4 credits) of MATH courses numbered MATH 237 or above, excluding mathematics courses numbered 301-309.

CS students typically choose their minor elective courses from among the following:

- MATH 237 (Calculus III) - 4 credits
- MATH 238 (Linear Algebra with Differential Equations ) - 4 credits
- MATH 245 (Discrete Mathematics) - 3 credits (as stated above, this can substitute for CS 227 as the CS discrete math requirement)
- MATH 248 (Computers and Numerical Algorithms) - 3 credits
- MATH 300 (Linear Algebra) - 3 credits
- MATH 318 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics) - 4 credits (as stated above, this can substitute for MATH 220 or 229 as the CS statistics requirement)
