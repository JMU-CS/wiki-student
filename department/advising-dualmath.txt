A minor or dual major in mathematics is an excellent pairing with computer science. Many interesting areas / problems in computer science require more advanced mathematics than is required of general computer science students. For example, graphics programming and machine learning both rely heavily on linear algebra. 


===== Courses that Double Count for CS and Math =====

Cross listed courses automatically count as both a CS and a Math course. Other courses may count under certain circumstances. Below is a list of both cross listed courses and others that can count.

CS courses that can count as mathematics courses: 

  * CS 452 is cross listed as Math 452. 

Math courses that can count as CS courses: 

  * MATH 227 (Discrete Structures I): cross-listed as CS 227
  * MATH 245 (Discrete Mathematics): A C- or better in this course can be used in place of CS 227 to satisfy the CS discrete math requirement. A student will need to obtain an override from the CS Undergraduate Program Director to sign up for CS 240 since MyMadison only knows the prerequisite of CS 227.
  * MATH 318 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics): A C- or better in this course can be used in place of MATH 220 or MATH 229 to satisfy the CS statistics requirement.
  * MATH 448 (Numerical Analysis): cross-listed as CS 448
  * MATH 449 (Numerical Analysis for Differential Equations): cross-listed as CS 449
