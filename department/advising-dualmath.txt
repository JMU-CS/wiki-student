A minor or dual major in mathematics is an excellent pairing with computer science. Many interesting areas / problems in computer science require more advanced mathematics than is required of general computer science students. For example, graphics programming and machine learning both rely heavily on linear algebra. 


===== Courses that Double Count for CS and Math =====

Cross listed courses automatically count as both a CS and a Math course. Other courses may count under certain circumstances. Below is a list of both cross listed courses and others that can count.

CS courses that can count as mathematics courses: 

* CS 452 is cross listed as Math 452. 

Math courses that can count as CS courses: 

* Math 227 is cross listed as CS 227.
* Math 245 Discrete Math. A C- or better in this course can be used in place of CS 227 to satisfy the discrete math requirement. A student will need to obtain an override from the CS Undergraduate Program Director to sign up for CS 240 since MyMadison only knows the prerequisite of CS 227. 
* Math 448 is cross listed as CS 448. 
* Math 449 is cross listed as CS 449.
