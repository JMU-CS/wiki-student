===== Graduation Process and Forms =====

You must complete an application to graduate by about the middle of the semester **before** the semester you plan to graduate. For example, if you plan to graduate in May 20xx then you must turn in your application by about the middle of the fall semester 20xx-1. The registrar's web page has specific due dates.

The application to graduate (for computer science) consists of the {{http://www.jmu.edu/registrar/wm_library/app_bach_deg.pdf | Application to Graduate form}}, a copy of an unofficial transcript (available from MyMadison), and a complete CS Graduation Checksheet for your catalog year (available below). Your catalog year is the year you started at JMU (unless you have changed it officially with the registrar).

Prepare you paperwork and take it to your minor/second major advisors and department heads for their signatures. Then take it your CS advisor for a signature, and then to the CS assistant department head. The CS department will forward the application to the registrar.
