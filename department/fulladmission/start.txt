====== Full Admission to the CS Major or the CS Minor ======

You will be guaranteed full admission to the CS major or minor, if your average grade in CS 149 and CS 159 is a 3.0 or better, and if you have not repeated either of the two courses. If you took CS 149 in Spring 2020 and received a grade of CR, then you need a grade of B or better in CS 159. If you took CS 149 or 159 in Spring 2020 or Fall 2020 and needed to repeat it in in the subsequent semester, then we are not counting this as a repeat. Students who meet the criteria for guaranteed admission //still have to apply//:

=== Detailed Admission Criteria ===

Any student may declare a CS major or minor, but students may enroll in CS courses beyond CS 149,
CS 159, and CS/MATH 227 only if they are fully admitted to the CS major or minor. Full admission to the
major or minor is granted as described below.

  * Students who have attempted CS 149, CS 159, or CS/MATH 227 at JMU may not attempt them elsewhere (that is, they must make any second attempts at JMU).

  * Students must submit an application for full admission to the CS major or minor no earlier than the semester in which they complete CS 159. The application is done electronically via an online survey. You need to have a PDF file of your unofficial transcript ready for upload.

  * Students with a GPA of 3.0 or better in CS 149 and CS 159 who have attempted these classes only once are guaranteed full admission to the major or minor. Others will be granted full admission to the CS major or minor as space permits based on their GPA in CS 149 and CS 159 and faculty evaluation of their potential to succeed in the CS major or minor.

  * Students who have completed the CS minor may apply for full admission to the CS major no earlier than the semester in which they complete the last course in the CS minor.

  * CS minors with a GPA of 3.0 or higher in the CS minor will be fully admitted to the CS major; others will be admitted as space permits based on their minor GPA.

  * Students will be notified of their CS major or minor admission status by January 1st for admission in the spring semester (following application the previous fall semester), and by May 15th for admission in the fall semester (following application the previous spring semester).

  * Students who applied for full admission will not be able to register for their next CS classes (e.g. CS 240, CS 261, and/or CS 345) until they have been notified that they are fully admitted. Thus, during early enrollment, students should register for GenEd and other major or minor classes, leaving space or placeholder classes in their schedule which can later be filled with the CS classes.

  * Students who are not granted full admission to the CS major or minor may file one additional application in the next regular semester after they are denied admission.

  * Transfer students who have completed the equivalent of CS 159 (or for whom this class is waived) are granted full admission to the CS major or minor. Other transfer students are subject to same process as non-transfer students.
