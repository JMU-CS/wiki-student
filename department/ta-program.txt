====== JMU CS TA Program ======
We have an [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3478432.3499148|internationally recognized]] leadership and professional development program in which our undergraduate majors and minors learn technical and professional skills while working to support their peers working to apply to the CS major.

===== TA Lab Hours =====
Our TAs support student learning by being available to discuss students' questions and course-related problems in an on-campus computer lab for several convenient hours, and an online videocall five days/week. See more details including the current semester's schedule and instructions for joining the online support call on the [[department:cs-success:start|TA Hours]] page.

===== In-Class TA =====
For instructors of our intro courses (CS 149 and CS 159) who choose to work with a TA, our trained undergraduate TAs regularly attend some or all of the courses' meetings (at the preference of the instructor) to help facilitate in-person activities such as labs and [[https://cspogil.org/Home|POGIL]] activities.
