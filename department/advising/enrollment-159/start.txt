====== Applications for Full Admission ======

If you are taking CS 159 this semester and want to continue in the CS major or minor, you have to apply for full admission to the major or minor this semester. All application must be received by the last day of classes (May 4th, 2023).

You will be guaranteed full admission to the CS major or minor, if your average grade in CS 149 and CS 159 is a 3.0 or better, and if you have only attempted CS 159 once. However, regardless of your grades //you still need to apply.//

Students who are not guaranteed full admission will be granted full admission to the CS major or minor as space permits based on their GPA in CS 149 and CS 159 and faculty evaluation of their potential to succeed in the CS major or minor.

**All students who want to be fully admitted to the major or minor must apply, regardless of whether or not you will be guaranteed admission!** 

The application is done electronically through an online survey: https://jmu.questionpro.com/t/ARXgAZxnhm

You will need to upload a PDF file of your unofficial transcript along with the other information we request, so make sure you have that ready.

When you complete the application, you will receive an email confirmation, which you should review to make sure all the information is correct.
