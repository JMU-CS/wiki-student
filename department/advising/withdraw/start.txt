**Financial Aid** : \\
Each student’s financial aid situation is different, but keep in mind that you could be in danger of losing financial aid eligibility if you drop a class. Financial Aid recommends that you meet with them to discuss your individual situation and how that impacts your Satisfactory Academic Progress.
