==== When You Enroll ====

**Dealing with Enrollment Issues**
  * If you get an error: //read the error//. 
  * If you have an error about a prerequisite: you have to contact the department responsible for the course you need. Start with contacting the listed professor and check the department’s Faculty and Staff listing to see if they have a departmental advisor. 
  * See [[https://www.jmu.edu/registrar/students/FAQ.shtml#Set-2-A|error FAQs]]
  * Note: you cannot enroll in courses when the section number start with OP. These are reserved for Adult Degree Students and are not available to regular undergraduate students. (e.g. ISCI  101 - OP01)
  * Note: you cannot enroll in a CS Independent Study without first discussing this option with a CS faculty member, getting their approval to oversee the Independent Study, and establishing a plan for the course.

**If something else goes wrong during your Enrollment**
  * take a deep breath.
  * Google it; see if you can find any info from a jmu.edu page

The CS Department can only handle overrides for CS classes. If you are having an issue with enrolling in a CS course, email the CS Advisor, [[mailto:normanap@jmu.edu|normanap@jmu.edu]] and include:
  * A screenshot of the issue you’re having
  * Your standing (Freshmen, Sophomore, etc)
  * Your full name and EID
  * If you are requesting an override for a CS course, include the section number (e.g. CS 159-0003) of the course you are trying to get into.
  * **DO NOT** separately email any other CS faculty. If you want to include any other CS faculty, CC them on your email to the CS Advisor. Separate emails forces us to duplicate work and degrades our effectiveness and speed to help CS students. 

**Overrides**

When you receive an override, this gives you //permission// to enroll in the course. __YOU__ will need to enroll in the course. If you've had the course in your shopping cart, remove it. After the override is processed, you will receive an automated email notifying you and you can then add the class and enroll.

**Open Enrollment**

After all students have had initial access to enrollment (4 days), open enrollment allows you to enroll in courses to fine-tune your schedule. Open enrollment begins April 14, 2023.

Note: Registration will close for currently enrolled students in early Dec/late May so that incoming Transfer and First Year students can enroll. Open Enrollment will resume in early January/early August. Exact dates TBD.
