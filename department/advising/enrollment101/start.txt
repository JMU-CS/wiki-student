===== Freshmen Mid-Semester Grades =====

Mid-semester grades will be posted **March 16, 2021**.
Please check your grades in MyMadison.
Some grades may be available earlier
These unofficial grades will give you a sense of where you stand in each of your courses.

=== D or F Grades ===

If you have any mid-semester grades of D or F, please make plans to discuss your progress, possible options, and available resources with your professor and the CS Advisor, bit.ly/cs-advisor 


===== Withdraw Deadline =====

The deadline to Withdraw from a semester class is **Friday, March 19th**.
Withdrawal from a course by this deadline will result in a "W" on your transcript.
A "W" is not calculated into the GPA, but it is factored in to the formula for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) used by Financial Aid.
Any student receiving Financial Aid should review [[https://www.jmu.edu/financialaid/learn/sap/|https://www.jmu.edu/financialaid/learn/sap/]] AND consult with the Financial Aid office before withdrawing from a course.
You do NOT need permission to withdraw, BUT, we highly recommend that you also discuss it with your advisor too.

=== Withdrawing AFTER March 19 ===

Any student wanting to withdraw from a class after the March 19th deadline can only do so when an instructor agrees to issue a final grade of "WP" (withdraw pass) or "WF" (Withdraw Fail) based on grade at time of withdrawal.
This option is strictly at the discretion of the instructor, and most will only consider it if there is a legitimate issue or extenuating circumstance.
We suggest that you come and discuss your need BEFORE you approach your professor.

===== Fall 2021 Enrollment =====

Fall 2021 enrollment appointments begin April 19th.
Look at MyMadison for YOUR appointment date and time.
Your enrollment day based on your standing - [[https://www.jmu.edu/registrar/students/fall_enroll_time.shtml|see details]]

If you do not know what to sign up for, please make an appointment with the CS advisor.
During OPEN ENROLLMENT, you can expect SOME movement in classes, so you are welcome to continue to look for classes through the second Tuesday of the Fall semester 2021.
HOWEVER, do NOT count on finding a seat in a specific class.

We recommend that you **enroll in 15-16 credit hours during your advance registration appointment**, and then SWAP when you find a course you really want with an open seat.

=== Check for Holds! ===

There are a number of students who are non-compliant with their immunizations and currently have a hold on their account that will prevent them from enrolling in spring classes.
All have been sent multiple emails explaining what is missing and the consequences.
Check to make sure that YOU do not have a HOLD.
You MUST take care of holds prior to enrollment!

=== What courses should YOU take? ===

See the [[department/curriculum/start|CS Curriculum]] page on the wiki.

Also see the [[department:advising:start|Advising FAQ]]


=== Making a 4-year Plan ===

We encourage you to meet with our CS Advisor, Paige Normand, to make a 4-year plan for graduation.
You can schedule a meeting with her here: [[https://bit.ly/cs-advisor|https://bit.ly/cs-advisor]].

Not sure if you should reach out to Paige Normand or your CS Faculty Advisor about a topic?
Don't worry, there's a [[department:advising-resources:|Wiki Page]] for that!

  * Find your enrollment period and set calendar reminders. See: MyMadison > Student Center > Enrollment Dates

**The Day of your Enrollment**
  * If you get an error: //read the error//. 
  * If you have an error about a prerequisite: you have to contact the department responsible for the course you need. Start with contacting the listed professor and check the department’s Faculty and Staff listing to see if they have a departmental advisor. 
  * See [[https://www.jmu.edu/registrar/students/FAQ.shtml#Set-2-A|error FAQs]]

**If something else goes wrong during your Enrollment**
  * take a deep breath.
  * Google it; see if you can find any info from a jmu.edu page
If you need the help of the CS Advisor, email [[mailto:normanap@jmu.edu|normanap@jmu.edu]] and include:
  * A screenshot of the issue you’re having
  * Your standing (Freshmen, Sophomore, etc)
  * Your full name and EID
  * **DO NOT** separately email any other CS faculty. If you want to include any other CS faculty, CC them on your email to the CS Advisor. Separate emails forces us to duplicate work and degrades our effectiveness and speed to help CS students.
