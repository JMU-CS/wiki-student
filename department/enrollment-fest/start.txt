**If something else goes wrong during your Enrollment**
  * take a deep breath.
  * Google it; see if you can find any info from a jmu.edu page

If the error is for a non-CS course, you will need to reach out directly to the professor teaching the course. Each department handles their own overrides, the CS department can only assist with CS courses (not Math courses). 

If the error is for a CS course, email the CS Advisor, email [[mailto:normanap@jmu.edu|normanap@jmu.edu]] and include:
  * A screenshot of the issue you’re having
  * Your standing (Freshmen, Sophomore, etc)
  * Your full name and EID
  * If you are requesting an override for a CS course, include the section number (e.g. CS 159-0003)
  * **DO NOT** separately email any other CS faculty. If you want to include any other CS faculty, CC them on your email to the CS Advisor. Separate emails forces us to duplicate work and degrades our effectiveness and speed to help CS students. 

**Open Enrollment**

After all students have had initial access to enrollment (4 days), open enrollment allows you to enroll in courses to fine-tune your schedule. Open enrollment begins April 15, 2022.

Note: Fall 2022 registration will close for currently enrolled students on Friday, May 27th at 12PM for Transfer and Freshman Orientation. Registration will reopen on Monday, August 1st at 12:01AM.
