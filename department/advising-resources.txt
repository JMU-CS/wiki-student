Every student who declares the CS Major is assigned two advisors in MyMadison: \\
  - An Academic Advisor: **Paige Normand**, the Departmental Advisor to all CS students
  - A Faculty Advisor: **a CS professor** who is available to answer content-specific questions

You are always welcome to [[https://jmu-cs.as.me/advisor|book a meeting]] with Paige Normand or send her quick questions over email.
 
To meet with your Faculty Advisor, email them or check [[https://www.jmu.edu/cs/people/faculty-staff/|their personal site]] for details about their calendar.
